# TYPO3 Extension 'tight'

This extension injects a tiny CSS file to the backend of TYPO3 **13.4** to reduce the vast space set between the UI elements.

Simply to get a tighter backend UI and thus an improved UX.

## Configuration

None necessary.

But you can alter the level of tightness in the extension settings.
