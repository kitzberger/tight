# TYPO3 Extension 'tight'

This extension injects a tiny CSS file to the backend of TYPO3 **13.4** to reduce the vast space set between the UI elements.

Simply to get a tighter backend UI and thus an improved UX.

## Configuration

Adjust the level of tightness in the extension settings for the 4 components:

* edit masks
* list module
* page module
* filelist module
